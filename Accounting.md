## Financial Reporting
* Balance Sheet
* Income Statement
* Statement of Cash Flows
* Statement of Stockholders' Equity

Balance Sheet records the financial status of a specific date, and the other three ones reflect changes in a period of time, e.g. a fiscal year.

## Balance Sheet Equation
Asset = Liability + Stockholders' Equity  
* Resource = Claims on Resources by Outsiders(Creditors) and Owners
* Must always be balanced
* Changes of Cash Flow, Income, and SE are summarized in IS, SCF, and SSE as below

Cash Asset + Non-Cash Asset = Liability + Contributed Capital + Retained Earnings  
* Statement of Cash Flows (IS) => Changes in Cash Asset
* Income Statement (SCF) => Changes in Retained Earnings
* Statement of Stockholders' Equity (SSE) => Changes in Stockholders' Equity  

Asset = Liability + Stockholders' Equity
Asset = Liability + Contributed Capital + Prior Retained Earnings + Retained Earnings
Asset = Liability + Contributed Capital + Prior Retained Earnings + Net Income - Dividends  
Asset = Liability + Contributed Capital + Prior Retained Earnings + Reveneue - Expense - Dividends

### Asset
* An asset is a resource that is expected to provide future economic benfits, i.e.
  * Generate future cash inflows
  * Reduce future cash outflows
* An asset is recognized when:  
  * It is acquired in a **past transaction or exchange** (e.g. sales amount would not be recognized as an asset if only a sales contract has been signed, as no transaction or exchange has occured yet, and account receivable would be recognized, because products have been delivered to customer)
  * The value of its future benefit can be measured with a reasonable degree of precision 

### Liability
* A liability is a claim on assets by "Creditors"(non-owners) that represents an obligation to make future payment of cash, goods, or services
* A liability is recognized when:
  * The obligation is based on **benefits or services recevied currently or in the past** (similar with asset, when employee signs a working contract with the company, the salary would not be recognized as a liability of the company, because the benefits or services provided by the employee has not occured yet, and account payable would be recognized as a liability, because supplier has already delivered inventory to the company, i.e. the company has already received the benefits from supplier)
  * The amount and timing of payment is reasonably certain
### Stockholders' Equity
* Stockholders' Equity is the residual claim on assets after settling claims of creditors (SE = Assets - Liability)
  * Also called "net worth", "net assets", "net book value"
* **Contributed Capital (arises from sales of shares)**
  * Common stock (par value)
  * Additional paid-in-capital (excess over par value)
  * Treasury stock (stock repurchased by company)
* **Retained Earnings (arises from operations)**
  * Accumulation of net income (revenue - expenses), less dividends, since start of business
  * Retained Earnings(END) = Retained Earnings(BEG) + Net Income - Dividends
### Dividens
* Not an expense
* Recorded as a reduction of retained earnings on the declaration date (creates a liability until payment date. The company keeps the cash corresponding to the dividends(benefit received currently) till the payment date, therefore it is a liability to the owners during this period)
